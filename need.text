The trivia game logic appears to be well-implemented with these key processes functioning properly:

Question Handling:

Questions are displayed one at a time
Multiple choice options are properly rendered
Correct/incorrect answer logic works as expected


Game State Management:

Transitions between 'playing', 'revealed', and 'gameOver' states
Proper handling of the game flow from question to question
Game over screen with collected items display


Scoring and Streak System:

Points are awarded based on difficulty (streakBonus)
Streak counter increases with correct answers
Power-ups are awarded at streak milestones (3, 5, 10)


Power-Up Mechanics:

All 5 power-ups (Shuffle, Shield, 50/50, Double Points, Heal) function correctly
The 50/50 power-up properly filters answer options
Shield protection works when activated


Collectible System:

Items are collected upon answering correctly
Modal displays with appropriate item information
Rarity levels affect the visual presentation
